# Cricket Data Analysis with Power BI  

This repository contains a **Cricket Data Analysis project**, where I leveraged Power BI to analyze cricket data and deliver insights through an interactive dashboard.  

## Overview  

Cricket is one of the most popular sports globally, and analyzing cricket data provides valuable insights into players' performance, match outcomes, and trends in the sport. This project showcases my data visualization and analysis skills using Power BI.  

## Features  

- **Data Exploration**: Insights into player performance, team statistics, match results, and key trends.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly Power BI dashboard with slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.  
- **Visual Insights**: Charts, graphs, and KPIs for quick interpretation of the data.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.  
- **Dataset**: Cricket data sourced from [mention data source, if any].  
- **Other Tools**: [List if you used Excel, SQL, or Python for preprocessing, if applicable].  

## Dashboard Highlights  

The Power BI dashboard includes:  
- **Player Performance Analysis**: Runs, wickets, strike rates, and averages.  
- **Team Statistics**: Win/loss ratios, team scores, and rankings.  
- **Match Trends**: Trends across different formats like ODI, T20, and Test cricket.  
- **Filters and Slicers**: Easy-to-use tools to explore data by teams, players, matches, and timeframes.
